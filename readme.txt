All code is located in the top-level directory as *.py files.

To run the code, first install the one dependency, numpy.  This can be done via:
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Then the code can be run as
$ python3 main.py <in.csv> <out.csv> [<cost weighting> <co2 weighting> <green weighting>]

The weightings are optional, and override the cost function we picked.
